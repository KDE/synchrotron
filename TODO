General
* i18n of user visible name and description in db; see include/i18n.php for some
  starting points
* make download counts actually based on downloads, not just accesses via
  download.php
* allow multiple source repositories so addons can be split up amongst different
  repos
* add "depends" support; this requires something in the metadata files, creating
  per-provider depends files when scan.php is run, adding depends fields to the
  output of list.php / get.php and accepting depends as a search filter

Scanner
* add tar+[gzip|bzip] compression
* generate categories files per-provider
* any need for other formats for metadata, besides KPluginInfo-style .desktop files?
* check that all dates and times are stored in UTC
* allow cusomtization of the providers.xml file; others may not want "KDE Synchrotron"
  as the name, after all ;) should probably be in the config file

Synchrotron Support of OCS
* add json support? not sure if it is even useful, but some might prefer it...
* list.php
    * add more fields to results?
    * make updatedsince and createdsince work with UTC dates
* get.php
    * add more fields to results?
* download.php
    * add more fields to results, perhaps mimetype?

=========
OCS itself

The OCS reference is here:

    http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services

As a specification, it is in need of improvements. Here are some shortcomings that
ought to be addressed:

* the XML returns are completely undocumented
* no file sizes in returns from download, list or get?
* the "download1", "download2", "download3" naming schemes should be replaced with _real_ xml
* mass update check mechanism; implemented updated since and new since params to list in
  synchrotron, but not in the specification; a real oversight for this kind of application
* request API of download is really underspecified: what's the real differencd between
  contentid and itemid? yes, you get to figure that our for yourself.
* the "list" command is actually "data" in the URL; nonsensical
